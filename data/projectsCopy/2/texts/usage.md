The mining lamp collection can be explored as a whole in a single Voyager instance whereby all lamps that were digitized can be viewed and explored via annotations, articles and guided tours. The first tour talks about mining lamp technology, manufacture and development within the context of early modern Europe. The second tour highlights the collector, Hans Dubbel, his life and his experiences as a miner from 1950-1970. 

Within the articles of each lamp there is a hyperlink to individual Voyager instances of the single lamp. The Voyager instances for each lamp contain information about the lamp's design and ownership (if known) as well as first-hand accounts from ex-miners about their experiences in the mines and their relationships with light and these lamps.
