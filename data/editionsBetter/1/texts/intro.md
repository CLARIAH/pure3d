Contested Memories: The Battle of Mount Street Bridge is one of the PURE3D Infrastructure Pilot Projects 
 in which we experiment with different modalities for communicating rich interfaces for 3D models.
 As such, we have been exploring delivering and contextualing content through an interface developed 
 by the Smithsonian Institution called Voyager Story.
 The Mount Street edition is funded by the Platform Digitale Infrastructuur - 
 Social Sciences and Humanities (PDI- SSH) and was awarded to Costas Papadopoulos and Susan 
 Schreibman. Significant contributions to this edition were made by Susan Schreibman, Kelly Schoueri, 
 Billy Campbell, Luca Moine, John Kaulakis and Sandra Martinez-Boheme.
