The Battle of Mount Street Bridge 3D Scholarly Model
is a 3D photorealistic construction of the area around Mount Street Bridge
that transports users back to a leafy suburb in Dublin, Ireland, in April 1916
to better understand the spatial and temporal dimensions
of one of the most important battles in the Easter Rising.
During this battle, the first of the week-long event, against all odds,
a small group of Irish Volunteers held off two battalions of
British soldiers for the better part of the day.
The goal of the project is to better understand the battle,
bringing new insights to this century-old event. 

The project contains four Voyager Instances
that help to tell both big narratives about the socio-political context of the 1916 Rising,
the events before, during and after the Battle of Mount Street Bridge,
as well as the human toll of the Battle of Mount Street Bridge
on individuals from both sides of the conflict.
The 3D models of the neighborhood and individual buildings
offer an interactive method of telling these stories.
Archival images, records and oral accounts enrich the 3D model of the buildings
so that the stories are authenticated by primary sources.
