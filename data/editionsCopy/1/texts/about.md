##ABOUT THE PROJECT

Contested Memories â€“ Battle of Mount Street Bridge is a Digital Humanities project directed by Susan Schreibman and Costas Papadopoulos at Maastricht University. The edition is developed as part of a pilot project for the PURE3D Infrastructure, funded by the Platform Digitale Infrastructuur - Social Sciences and Humanities (PDI- SSH). The project began in 2016 as part of the centennial commemoration of the Easter Rising and was developed out of Maynooth University. A 3D reconstruction of the Mount Street area of Dublin in 1916 was commissioned by the project and executed as an offline Unity application by 3D artist John Buckley. 

The Mount Street Project was re-invigorated in 2021 as a pilot project for the PURE3D Infrastructure. The 3D assets for the edition are presented using the Smithsonian Voyager Explorer online software in which text, images and other relevant multi-media about the battle is presented via annotation labels, articles and tours. 

In Spring 2022, an Honours Course at Maastricht University collaboratively authored a first draft of the Voyager Instance for 25 Northumberland Road. In June 2022, this instance was user-tested via a focus group and a Qualtrics Feedback Survey.
