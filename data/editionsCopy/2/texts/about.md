Lighting the Darkness: Dutch Mining Lamps is a 3D Scholarly Edition of 15 mining lamps from the collection of the ex-miner Hans Dubbel. The edition was developed by the Nederland Mining Museum in Heerlen, Limburg with the help of the PURE3D Project based out of Maastricht University. 

These 15 lamps are a selection of Han Dubbel's collection of more than 30 mining lamps ranging in date of manufacture from 1800-1970 and originating from countries across Continental Europe and the British Isles. The lamps tell both big narratives about the role of industrial coal mining in the Netherlands, how innovation in mining technology altered mining safety and practice as well as personal stories about the miners, their families and the coal mining communities. The goal of the digitisation effort is to make this collection of lamps available to online audiences so that they may appreciate and connect with the history of Dutch coal mining.
