Your browser does not support the audio element.In August of 1915, Grace deserted the Canadian army and returned to Ireland.
Grace would, however, not leave empty-handed. Despite leaving most of his
possessions behind, he did not leave unarmed, smuggling his standard-issue
Lee-Enfield rifle back to Ireland with 20 rounds of ammunition. He sailed on the
‘Cathagenia’ from Montreal, hiding the rifle under the mattress of his bunk.

Grace made landfall in Clyde, Scotland. From there, he took a train to Wales,
where he could at last make the crossing to Ireland. Around three miles off the
coast of Ireland, the ship’s bursar attempted to make him relinquish the rifle,
claiming that he should have declared it upon his departure from Canada.
Thinking quickly, Grace pushed past him, claiming that as they were this close
to shore, they were outside his jurisdiction. Grace would consequently land
safely in Kingstown, a port on the outskirts of Dublin proper, whereupon he
would take a tram into the city.

Upon his final arrival in Dublin, Grace immediately reported to the Irish
Volunteers, where he met Lt. Michael Malone.
