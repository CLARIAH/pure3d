In response to the first fusillade from No. 25, officers led a charge against
the building which ended in failure as all involved officers were shot. The
leading Captain Pragnell was wounded, while 2nd Lieutenant Hawken was killed.
Contemporary newspapers reported several more failed charges against the corner
building. The British were prevented from advancing for several hours, and
considered the position “strongly held”. One British soldier, Andrew Palmer,
recalled later their uncertainty of the number of Irish volunteers they were
facing.

assume 25 Northumberland Road was heavily occupied, there were only two men
inside: Michael Malone and Seamus Grace.
