# The Battle Begins

  |  | | --- | |  | |  |

The Sherwood Foresters’ made good progress into  Dublin until the head of their 
column reached the intersection of Haddington and Northumberland Roads. There
Grace and Malone opened fire  upon the advancing soldiers. The battle had begun.
The majority of British soldiers, however, were still on the march—more than a
kilometer behind where the fighting would start.

including four officers. While this is often characterised  this as an ambush,
Brigadier General Ernest Maconchy , the officer in command of the Foresters,
disagreed with this characterisation. In his eyes, his men in Dublin were no
more ‘ambushed’ than Western Front soldiers making a charge into no-man’s-land. 

Captain Dietrichsen was among the first mortally wounded. Though the heavy fire
from Northumberland 25 would inflict casualties upon all ranks, officers were
singled-out as priority targets, easily distinguished by carrying pistols and
sabres in place of the long rifles of non-commissioned soldiers.
