# Michael Malone's Death on the Main Stairway

The British troops managed to cut Malone and Grace off from each other leaving
them unable to enact their planned last stand at the top of the house. While
Grace managed to escape to the cellar, Malone was killed by rifle fire as he
descended the building’s main staircase. Grace recalled the moments leading up
to Malone’s death in his 1949 Bureau of Military History Statement:

After the battle ended in the small hours of the Wednesday night/ Thursday
morning, Malone’s body was buried by British soldiers in the backyard of 25
Northumberland Road but later was reinterred in the Republican Plot at Glasnevin
Cemetery. Grace described Malone as his ‘leader and comrade’.
