Despite the fact that the British Army had been making preparations to divert
troops towards Ireland for ‘Home Defense' when Patrick Pearse read out the
Proclamation of the Irish Republic on Monday, 24 April 1916, the British were
caught off guard. Shortly after the Proclamation was read, London was made aware
of the uprising and  before the end of the day, British troops in northeast
England were mobilised to supplement those already stationed in Ireland to
suppress the unrest. 

Among the troops mobilised were two battalions of the Sherwood Foresters, the
2/7th, (the Robin Hoods’)  and the 2/8th.  They departed by train for Liverpool
on the morning of the 25th, and in the evening sailed to the Irish port of
Kingstown (now Dún Laoghaire). Many of the enlisted  men and even some of the
officers did not know their intended destination.

When the order for mobilisation was received, many of the Foresters were
recruits still in training. Additionally, the training they had received was for
the trench warfare common to  the Western Front, which was to prove  inadequate
for the situation they found themselves in in Dublin, fighting in a built-up
area  or urban warfare.
