| The proclamation read by Patrick Pearse at Midday on Monday 24 April, 1916. |


Around midday on Monday 24 April 1916, Patrick Pearse read a proclamation on
behalf of the ‘Provisional Government of the Irish Republic’ at the front of the
General Post Office (GPO) on Dublin’s Sackville Street (now O’Connell Street).
This marked the symbolic opening of what is now most commonly referred to as the
Easter Rising (the British referred to it as a ‘rebellion’ or ‘insurrection’).
That day, over 1,200 members of the Irish Volunteers, the Irish Citizen Army,
Hibernian Rifles and Cumann na mBan occupied a series of buildings around
Dublin, as well as a public park at St. Stephens’ Green. The General Post Office
would become the headquarters for the Irish rebellion and the base for five of
the seven signees of the proclamation.
