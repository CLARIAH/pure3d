# Battle Preparations

At first 25 Northumberland Road was fortified by four men: Michael Malone, the
commanding officer, Seamus Grace, Paddy Rowe, and Michael Byrne. 

On Monday afternoon, the Gorgeous Wrecks who were training in the Wicklow
Mountains, heard about the Rising and marched back to Beggars Bush Barracks in
two columns. The first and smaller column came under fire by the men at 25
Northumberland Road and in which four killed and several wounded. It is largely
believed that none of the men were not armed. 

Two of the Volunteers in 25 were under the age of sixteen: Rowe and Bryne. In
the days leading up to the battle, the group would receive food, water and other
supplies from family members sympathetic to the cause.

In an ominous sign of what was to come, on Wednesday morning Malone sent the two
young Volunteers home for their own safety, telling them to deliver letters to
family members. The young volunteers protested, but yielded to Malone’s rank and
authority, evacuating the building. Malone is said to have then declared ‘We
know what we are dying for, thank God the day has come.’ (Catholic Bulletin,
1916).
