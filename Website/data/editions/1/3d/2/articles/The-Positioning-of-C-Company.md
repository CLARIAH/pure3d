# The Positioning of C Company

  |  | | --- | |  | | British and Irish positions at the time of the Battle. |

Irish Volunteers took up strategic positions around Dublin on Easter Monday in
anticipation of the British response, they positioned men on the main roads
leading to the city centre so as to block or at least impede the British
advance.

One such defense was taken up by C Company (led by Lieutenant Michael Malone)
who positioned his men in four buildings along Northumberland Road just south of
Mount Street Bridge: 25 Northumberland Road, Parochial Hall, the
Schoolhouse (abandoned on Tuesday as the position was too far back for clear
sightlines), and Clanwilliam House. C Company was attached to Éamon de Valera’s
3rd Battalion of the Irish Volunteers.

Although a British response was expected by the Irish resistance, there was no
guarantee as to where it would come from. As soon as C Company had taken their
positions, they were almost completely cut off from the outside world, save from
occasional resupplies from relatives, or news called out from the street.
