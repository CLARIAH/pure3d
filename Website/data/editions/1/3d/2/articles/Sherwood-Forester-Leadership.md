# Sherwood Forester Leadership

The Sherwood Foresters Brigade was overseen by Brigadier General Ernest
Maconchy, and the 2/7th Robin Hood Rifles by Lieutenant Colonel Cecil Fane,
assisted by Second-in-Command Major F. Rayner and Adjutant Captain Dietrichsen.Â 

The soldiers under their command were highly inexperienced and many had not yet
completed their basic training. As such, they were heavily dependent upon a
rigid hierarchy of command to maintain morale and carry out orders. The officers
would be singled out by the Irish volunteers, leading to confusion and delay.
