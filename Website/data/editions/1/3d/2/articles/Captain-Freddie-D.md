Captain Frederick "Freddie" Christian Dietrichsen was one of the senior officers
for the 2/7th battalion of the Robin Hoods. 

On the march into Dublin, around the area of Monkstown,  Captain Frederick
Christian Dietrichsen was greeted by his wife Beatrice, nèe Mitchell, whom he
had married before the war.. Beatrice was  Irish., and when the Germans began
Zeppelin  raids on British cities, Dietrichsen sent her and the children back to
Dublin to stay with her family. They had come to the roadside, along with
hundreds, even thousands of Irish, to cheer and support the British soldiers.
When Dietrichsen saw his family, he broke ranks to embrace them. It would be the
last time they would meet as he would be one of the first British soldiers to be
shot and killed by the Irish at 25 Northumberland Road. 

‘By his care, skill, and courtesy he endeared himself to all who knew him, and
those who belonged to the same profession felt a pang of losing a real, true
friend. He had left those he loved to serve his country when she needed his
services, and in Dublin had met his death on the field of honour.’
