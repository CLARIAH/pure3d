# Seamus Grace In Battle

Seamus Grace took up different positions on the second floor, moving from window
to window to find opportunities to fire where he could. Decades later, he would
recall the fear he felt as the gunfire and grenades of the British at times
paralysed him from action. Nevertheless, British casualties increased as the
afternoon progressed—as did their forward positioning along the road. 

In time, the British occupied more and more of Northumberland Road. They were
aided in clearing buildings and advancing troops by the use of explosives,
bombs, and, of course, greater  numbers. Grace and Malone’s forward position in
25 Northumberland Road was becoming increasingly untenable.
