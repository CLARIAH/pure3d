Despite being occupied by only two men, 25 Northumberland Road put up an
effective defense against the advancing British soldiers. As the Sherwood
Foresters approached, Malone took up position in a third floor bathroom window.
Armed with a modified Mauser automatic pistol (nicknamed a ‘Peter the Painter’),
Malone found opportunity to live up to his crack shot reputation and was
responsible for several of the casualties inflicted upon the British. 

His vantage point gave him many targets from behind effective cover including
the easily identifiable officers and especially those who tried to flank the
side of the building. These unsuccessful charges stalled the Sherwood Foresters
advance, buying Malone, Grace, and any other Irish Volunteers in firing range
more time to inflict casualties.
