# Archive system
A repository that accepts SIPs, stores them as AIPs and can export them as DIPs.
The SIPs come from [[SIP]], and the DIPs go to [[DIP]].
The AIPs are stored and harvestable, they get a PID.

## Ingredients
An on-premise installation of Archivematica.
Harvesting scripts that maintain an "index" of the AIPs in a MongoDb for the sake of disseminating editions.
